    <p>The colonial notes mark the birth of currency in the United States</p>
    <p>In 1690, the colonies of the United States did not have metal coin to use for their currency. Therefore they produced
    paper money to use for their system of currency. These notes were reffered to as "bills of credit" meaning tSchey could be
    exchanged for the silver coin used in Great Britain. However this system of notes would not be worth much shortly after
    development due to the colonies producing too much of the note. The currency outweighed the silver coin in Britain making
    it useless.</p>

    <p>Benjamin Franklin's Dive into Paper Money</p>
    <p>1739, Benjamin Franklin began using his printing firm, based in Philadelphia. He included unique nature-like markings in order
    ensure it could not be replicated. He was able to use the actual prints of leafs, making it nearly impossible for one to make a
    counterfit.</p>

    <h2 id="continental-currency">Continental Currency</h2>

    <img id="Continental-Image" src="Continental.jpg">

    <p>The Funding of the Revolutionary War</p>
    <p>Continental currency is the currency that funded the United States during the Revolutionary War in 1775. Like the colonial notes in 1690,
       the currency lost value due to the overprinting of the bills. For five years during the War they would print 200 million worth of notes.

    <p>The Symbol We Know and Love</p>
    <p>In 1785,the United States adopted the dollar sign. The dollar sign is in resemblence of pesos from Spanish America. This symbol would be
        the basis of United States currency through today.

    <p>The Finance of the Civil War</p>
    <p>Like the continental currency during the American Revolution, Greenbacks were used for funding the Civil War (1861). Their name comes from the
        appearance of green ink on their backs.

    <p>Allowed for a Person to Buy Silver Without the Physical Silver</p>
    <p> Issued between 1878-1964, silver certificates. These certificates would allow for more people to buy the silver currency. Eventually phased out
        in 1964, they no longer hold currency for silver as they once did.
